# MatrixCase
Top and bottom STL files for a prototype case for the Matrix Creator board.  The bump on the side is to house a buck converter for voltage regulation.

The opening in the back is for my custom mount so you may want to modify the file to remove it.  

You'll also notice that the large top opening has an inner lip to mount a transparent cover.
